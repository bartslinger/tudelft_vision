The Parrot Bebop is a Wi-Fi controlled flying quadrotor, designed to be operated with a smartphone or tablet via the
official FreeFlight app. The Bebop is a lightweight drone with a built-in HD camera.

At the end of 2015 Parrot released the Bebop 2, the successor to the Parrot Bebop. Both drones are supported by the
`Paparazzi <http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/>`__ community and pre-configured airframe files are available.


Where to start

You do not need to electronically modify the Parrot Bebop in order to fly with Paparazzi. It is recommended to first
