Getting started with Paparazzi
==============================


What is Paparazzi?
==================

Summarized from the `Paparazzi wiki <http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/>`__:

    '*Paparazzi is an open-source drone hardware and software project encompassing autopilot systems and ground station
    software for multicopters/multirotors, fixed-wing, helicopters and hybrid aircraft. Paparazzi enables
    users to add more features and improve the system. Using and improving Paparazzi is encouraged by the community.*'

Paparazzi is the recommended platform to implement computer vision behavior in drone flight. While the
Vision Library deals with the computer vision related hardware, Paparazzi is a complete airborne system and can be used
to (autonomously) operate almost any airframe. An example of such an airframe is the :doc:`Parrot Bebop </bebop>`.


Where to start
===============

New to Paparazzi? It can be quite overwhelming at first. This page covers the installation of paparazzi in Ubuntu
and will get you ready to start hacking. If you are not using Ubuntu, you can refer to the `wiki <http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Installation>`__
for details on how to install Paparazzi on other platforms.

.. note::

    Are you familiar with Git version control? Paparazzi is updated `regularly <https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pulse>`__
    and merging your work with others can be complicated. A human-readable introduction to Git can be found
    `here <https://red-badger.com/blog/2016/11/29/gitgithub-in-plain-english>`__. The offical book is hosted `here <https://git-scm.com/book>`__.
